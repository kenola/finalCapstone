Description

This project provides two financial calculators: an Investment Calculator and a Bond Calculator. These calculators help users calculate interest earned on investments and monthly repayments for home loans.

 Calculators

 Investment Calculator

The Investment Calculator allows users to calculate the amount of interest they'll earn on their investment. Users provide the principal amount, interest rate, investment duration in years, and the type of interest (simple or compound). The calculator then computes the total amount after the specified investment duration.

### Bond Calculator

The Bond Calculator helps users calculate the amount they'll have to pay on a home loan. Users input the present value of the house, the interest rate, and the number of months to repay the bond. The calculator then computes the monthly repayment amount.
